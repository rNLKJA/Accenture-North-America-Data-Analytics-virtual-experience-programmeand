## Background information

You’ve been assigned to a new project and the first thing you must do is get up to speed with the business problem that this project is tackling, the requirements that need to be fulfilled as deliverables and the alignment of internal teams with the client.

You will be working within a large team at Accenture and there will be several people on your team doing different roles to make this project a success.

As a data analyst, it is imperative that you have a solid understanding of the project as quickly as possible. A data analyst sits between the business and the data, so it’s important that you have a deep understanding from both sides to provide insights. You need to use the client brief to:

- Understand the client and business problem at hand.
- Identify the requirements that need to be delivered for this project.
- Identify which tasks you should focus on.

To make sure that you have understood the project, you will be tested on an outline of the business problem, the requirements and the delegation of tasks.

## Tasks

1. Client background

   Before attempting to complete this task, you should take your time to fully understand the client brief.

2. Internal background

   After this, you should read through the organization map and each individual's role and responsibilities. This will give you a holistic understanding of the Accenture team working on this project and each individuals’ role and responsibilities.

3. Project understanding

   Once you’ve read these resources, make sure you have a confident understanding of the following three questions:

   1. What is the business problem that Accenture is trying to tackle for this client?
   2. Based on this business problem, what are the requirements that Accenture is expected to deliver?
   3. Finally, based on these requirements, what tasks are most likely to be relevant to you as the data analyst?

   After reading the first two documents, you should be able to construct an answer to the 3 above questions.
