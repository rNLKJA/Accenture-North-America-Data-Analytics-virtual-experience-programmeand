## Background information

Now it is time to present back to the client! Use your slide deck along with storytelling techniques to deliver a compelling presentation and to present your hard work to the client.

Imagine you are presenting to this client in person and there are stakeholders from Accenture and the client within the room. It may be nerve-wracking, but this is the time we get to show that we’ve done a great job! The success of this task falls on this presentation. As a data analyst working with both the business and the data, this is a lot of responsibility but a great opportunity to show your talent!

When presenting back to the client there are a few things that you should remember:

- Firstly, they may not all be technical, so you need to make sure you talk to them in business-friendly language
- Secondly, you want to show them that you’ve understood their business and requirements, so use their terminology and use any domain-specific language that is relevant to the task.
- Thirdly, this is your time to shine and to show them how great you are! Try to present your work with confidence and conviction, if you don’t feel confident talking about your results then it’s a good indication that you don’t understand them fully or may need to revisit the dataset! Speaking about your results should feel natural when you explain what you’ve done.

## Tasks

1. Prepare

   A good presentation always takes a lot of preparation. The more you practice presenting your content, the more confident you will be when the time comes. Practice with your housemates, friends, family, anyone that is free! Ask for feedback and keep improving until you’re happy with your presentation and you’re confident in presenting your content.

2. Present

   It is now your time to make a video recording of your presentation back to the client. It should be concise, engaging and should guide the audience on a journey with the use of storytelling to take them through the insights that you’ve uncovered and how they address the requirements. Recording the video may require a few attempts until you’re happy with the final recording, but this shouldn't take you longer than 30 minutes, since your presentation should be no longer than 10 minutes long.
